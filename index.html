      <P> "My interests in the IT industry is mainly confined to the software realm. Things like programming, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Although I am interested in computer science and how PCs work on a hardware level, but I am by no means an expert at any of these things. My interest in the industry began when I got my first computer when I was 4 or 5. But it really picked up in high school where I started learning C Sharp. Since then I've learnt HTML/CSS, Java, Assembly, Python, Javascript and Microsoft's SmallBasic language." </P>

      <p> Interests in IT: </p>

      <p> "My interest in IT is mostly around computer programming. My major interest in IT began when I attended the computer program at the selective high school I attended. However the initial spark was when my father let me have his really old Tandy Windows 3.1 powered computer, on which I taught myself QBasic. My major IT experience began in high school where I learned C++ and some Java. I also learned about computer hardware and repair along with gaining a CompTIA A+ certification. After high school I joined a computer science degree, however, I never finished it and ended up going down a completely different path. Now my IT experience is primarily casual and mostly fueled by gaming and my current career. My love of gaming inspired me to build my own computer which I still use to this day. My current career, while not IT focused, has allowed me to keep my analytical and computer skills sharp." </p>

      <p> Interest in IT: </p>

      <p> "My interest in information technology stemmed from a fascination with space exploration - I’m obsessed with the idea of humanity becoming a space faring civilisation. This led me to a general interest in technology as I drew correlations between our society’s progression toward this exciting future and technology enabling this. The ‘Big Bang’ of my interest in space and consequently technology occurred at the age of 11 during a visit to an observatory which was the first time I had ever had a detailed look at the moon through the telescope housed at the observatory. It’s taken me a while to professionally explore my interest in IT." </p>

      <p> Interest in IT: </p>

      <P> "My interest in IT started way back in the 90’s when my dad gave me an old brick of a Toshiba laptop. It had a monochrome screen and ran Windows 95 – which is really showing my age – but I was obsessed with learning how to use it. After that, the only thing I ever wanted was a computer and the internet which finally came around in the form of dial up. I always used the internet as my primary form of social interaction because it was fascinating to be able to have access to people from all over the world and I’m even married to someone I met on the internet 15 years ago! It seemed like a logical thing to start studying when I left high school but life gets in the way and I continued to view IT as a hobby and got on with doing other things with my life." </P>

      <p> "I am interested in IT as I have a personality that enjoys solving challenging problems and helping people. My first experience with IT was when I was given an Apple 2+ computer for Christmas which I used for gaming and programming. During my schooling teachers would ask me for assistance with their computers. After school I did a job as a junior programmer. From there I moved into network support and help desk then onto managing larger networks and systems." </p>
