      <p> Interest in IT: </p>

      <P> "My interests in the IT industry is mainly confined to the software realm. Things like programming, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Although I am interested in computer science and how PCs work on a hardware level, but I am by no means an expert at any of these things. My interest in the industry began when I got my first computer when I was 4 or 5. But it really picked up in high school where I started learning C Sharp. Since then I've learnt HTML/CSS, Java, Assembly, Python, Javascript and Microsoft's SmallBasic language." </P>

      <p> Interests in IT: </p>

      <p> "My interest in IT is mostly around computer programming. My major interest in IT began when I attended the computer program at the selective high school I attended. However the initial spark was when my father let me have his really old Tandy Windows 3.1 powered computer, on which I taught myself QBasic. My major IT experience began in high school where I learned C++ and some Java. I also learned about computer hardware and repair along with gaining a CompTIA A+ certification. After high school I joined a computer science degree, however, I never finished it and ended up going down a completely different path. Now my IT experience is primarily casual and mostly fueled by gaming and my current career. My love of gaming inspired me to build my own computer which I still use to this day. My current career, while not IT focused, has allowed me to keep my analytical and computer skills sharp." </p>
