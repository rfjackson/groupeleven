</p>
<p><strong>Position Description</strong></br>
The job as described in the advertisement is for an IT manager who is proactive and able to cover all levels of service required.</br>
Reading the ideal candidate description conveys that they are looking for an all rounder who is able to operate with minimal assistance and is capable of building the systems which are required as they currently don’t exist.</br>
This makes the job very attractive for me as I enjoy operating in a fluid and dynamic environment where you have to be capable and actively building solutions.</br>
</br>
<p><strong>Skills and Experience required</strong></br>
This job is looking for a person with the ability to work without supervision and interact with management and stakeholders on a professional level with the skills to influence both groups.</br>
There is no mention of a formal qualification which implies that the company is looking for someone with more practical experience such as Office 365 and an established history of working in a similar role.</br>
</br>
<p><strong>Skills and Experience I have</strong></br>
My thirty years of experience in the IT industry means that I have covered all of the minimum requirements and the experience required.</br>
I have operated at a level reporting to CEO's, boards and to internal and external stakeholders for orgisations from 5 to 20,000 employees.</br>
My best fit to the job requirements is in the Ideal candidate section where I have experience with building IT systems and creating solutions for businesses without an already established IT department or infrastructure.</br>
</br>
<p><strong>Plan for obtaining additional Skils</strong></br>
While I already have the experience and skills for the job, I believe that the addition of a degree would ensure that my application would be moved to above any similar qualified and experienced applicant who doesn’t have a degree.
