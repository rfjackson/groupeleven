Hi, my name is Lachlan O'Neill, I'm 17 and I live in Queensland, more specifically, Brisbane, I work as an administrator for a disability support company on the Gold Coast.
I graduated Year 12 last year. I was originally going to study a diploma of Software Development at TAFE and then continue with a Bachelor of IT with QUT afterwards, but I thought I might as well try and apply for the qualification through OUA anyway, so here I am.
Some of my hobbies include video games, Dungeons and Dragons and reading.

Some of my favourite video games are Super Smash Bros. Melee, Dragonball Fighterz and Pokemon, I play all three of these competitively which might have something to do with my feelings towards them.
I bought Persona 5 on the PS3 back in March and it quickly became one of my favourites as well, I completed it in a week! It's soundtrack is a complete bop the whole way through.
That was actually the main reason I bought it!

I have Cerebral Palsy so I'm dependent on a wheelchair, it limits my capabilities somewhat, but I'm not to restricted in everyday activities, it's physical activity I have a hard time in.
Which might explain my choice in hobbies, also my gamertag Wheelz!
Honestly though, my disability isn't too limiting to me, I have a knack for finding ways I can do things.

I think my ideal job is something to do with software or web development. Really anything to do with coding, that's where my main interest is in IT. I don't know what exactly I want to do, but that's a good start right?
I've learnt quite a few languages in my spare time; Python, Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS (really coming in handy here lmao), C#, and Assembly.
I originally wanted to go into the security part of IT but it was all very daunting to a beginner, it's still an interest of mine though.
