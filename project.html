        <h2> Our Project </h2>

        <p> Our group project is a simple tool to be used in conjunction with the "Pokémon" video game series developed by Game Freak. Our tool will assist the competitive battling scene with quick and easy generation of competition ready Pokémon to be used for battles online with wi-fi or locally with wireless communication. Our tool will generate Pokémon as plain text files in the format described below: </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: none; font-family: monospace; font-size: 20px;">

            <li> Species (Gender) @ Item </li>

            <li> IVs (If specified): # Stat / # Stat / # Stat </li>

            <li> EVs: # Stat / # Stat / # Stat / # Stat </li>

            <li> Ability: Ability Name </li>

            <li> Shiny: (Yes/No) </li>

            <li> (Nature Name) Nature </li>

            <li> - Move 1 </li>

            <li> - Move 2 </li>

            <li> - Move 3 </li>

            <li> - Move 4 </li>
        
        </ul>

        <p> This format has been officially adopted by the Pokémon community and is widely used to quickly spread teams online allowing for critique, criticism and feedback on producing Pokémon better suited to a strategy. Then once the user has finished editing the team, they can then import it into their save game using PKHex an external save modification tool that supports the above format. Or if they want to test the team before importing it into their game, they can use Pokémon Showdown! a web-based Pokémon battle simulator used by professionals to test teams and strategies. </p>

        <p> The ethics of using these generated Pokémon is a hotly debated topic amongst the community, because getting into the competitive scene has a much higher barrier for entry than most games, many people are fine with the use of these Pokémon. However, many people think that using the hacked creatures is cheating and think that players should breed for hours if not days in order to obtain one correct Pokémon out of the six in a team. </p>

        <p> The rules of the official Nintendo Pokémon Video Game Championships (VGC) state that <i> “The use of external devices, such as a mobile app, to modify or create items or Pokémon in a player’s Battle Team is expressly forbidden. Players found to have Pokémon or items that have been tampered with may receive a Disqualification, regardless of whether the Pokémon or items belong to that player or were traded for,” </i> and that <i> “A player’s Battle Team may be checked at any time for illegal Pokémon by using an electronic or manual team check.” </i> If these Pokémon are generated correctly, the team checks will be unable to discern any difference between a generated Pokémon and a Pokémon caught legitimately. </p>

        <p> Some argue that because these Pokémon could potentially be obtained in game without cheating, it is perfectly fine for them to use these Pokémon in a tournament setting. But because it is expressly forbidden by the rules of the event we as are obligated to say (regardless of our personal opinion) that we do not condone the use of these generated Pokémon in an official VGC event and that you only use these Pokémon in unofficial events set up by the community or in local battle between friends. </p>
